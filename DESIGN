ship - Packages Shipper

A 'system' is an individual computer upon which actions can be done. A 'manifest' describes a list of
packages. A 'package' is an archive of files, a 'hook' file, and a 'list' file. The hook file is a
ruby script that executes upon package shipment which may execute aribtrary tasks. A 'list' file is
a list of all possible files created by the package during shipment.

A computer can define multiple 'systems', each given a unique identifier when created. One of them
is default. This allows the creation of multiple install roots.

Installing a package:
	* lookup package name in repo manifest(s) to get a package object
	* query target for system object
	* send package object to system
	* system receives package object and authenticates, validates
	* system unpacks files, installs files, runs hook file
	* system updates local installed manifest
	* system returns OK.

Client-server model. If target is 'local', skip the client-server model, pass directly.
